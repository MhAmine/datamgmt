Starting email text
-------------------

> Hello \_\_\_\_\_, Thank you for your recent submission to the NSF Arctic Data Center. We will review your dataset and get back to you with any suggestions.
>
> From my preliminary examination of your submission I have noticed a few items that I would like to bring to your attention. We are happy to make any edits for you. See comments below:
>
> \[COMMENTS HERE\]

> Best,

> \[YOUR NAME\]

### Deadlines

If the PI is checking about dates/timing:

> We process submissions in the order in which they are received, and yours still has a few ahead of it in our queue. Are you facing any deadlines? If so, we may be able to expedite publication of your submission.

### Pre-set DOI's

If the PI needs DOI's right away:

> We can provide you with pre-set DOI's that you can reference in your paper. However, they will not render until we are finished processing your submission.

Title
-----

#### Provides the *what, where, and when* of the data

> We would like to add some more context to your data set title. A descriptive title that provides context about the where, what, and when of a dataset is often far more useful in search results. Something like: ‘OUR SUGGESTION HERE, WHERE, WHEN’ might be an option.

#### Does not use acronyms

> We noticed that your title contains several acronyms. In order to increase discoverability of your title, we recommend spelling out the acronyms.

Abstract
--------

#### Minimum 100 words

> Your abstract, while informative, appears to be missing some information. We suggest that the abstract be sufficiently descriptive for a general scientific audience. It should provide an overview of the scientific context/project/hypotheses, how this data set fits into the larger project, a synopsis of the experimental or sampling design, and a summary of the data contents. If you prefer and it is appropriate, we could add language from the abstract in the NSF Award found here: \[NSF AWARD URL\]

Data
----

#### At least one data file

> We noticed that no data files were submitted. With the exception of sensitive social science data, NSF requires the submission of all data products prior to publication. Do you intend to submit data files?

#### No xls/xlsx files

> We noticed that the data files submitted are in xlsx format. Please convert your files to a plain text/csv (or other open source format) in order to facilitate an accurate transfer of information to future researchers and ensure preservation of the data in perpetuity.

#### File contents and relationships among files are clear

> Could you provide a short description of the files submitted? Information about how each file was generated (what software, source files, etc.) allows other scientists to reproduce your work.

#### All attributes are clearly defined

Check for descriptions of abbreviations and units:

> Could you describe \_\_\_\_?

> Please define “X”.

> Please define “XYZ”, including the unit of measure.

> What are the units of measurement for the columns labeled “ABC” and “XYZ”?

#### Column names do not use spaces or special characters

> Data files should include column headers without special characters or spaces (i.e., Exp\_no, NO3\_M, Organic\_M, as per “Some Simple Guidelines for Effective Data Management” - <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/0012-9623-90.2.205/full>).

#### NA's are defined.

> What do the NA's in your measurements represent? (instrument failure, etc.)

> We noticed that the data files contain blank cells. What do these represent?

Contacts
--------

#### At least one contact with email and orcid

Temporal/geographic coverage
----------------------------

#### Includes coverage that makes sense.

Funding
-------

#### At least one funding number

#### If there are multiple submissions with the same funding number/creators, check about nesting

> Thank you for your submission to the Arctic Data Center. Based on the NSF awards, your most recent submission and the \[PACKAGE NAME\] package appear to be related. Would you like your submission(s) grouped with the other data sets funded by the same award? If so, we are happy to do all this grouping for you.

> Thank you for your submission to the Arctic Data Center. Based on the NSF awards, your most recent submission and the \[PACKAGE NAME\] parent package seem like disparate projects, is that correct?

> Nesting data sets under a common “parent” is beneficial so that all data sets funded by the same award can be found in one place. This way additional data sets can be added to the group without altering existing ones. Once we process all the “child” data sets you upload, we can group them under the same “parent”. The parent will not contain any data files itself, but will be populated with metadata only.

Methods
-------

#### Enough detail is provided in metadata

Submissions should:

-   provide instrument names
-   specify how sampling locations were chosen
-   provide citations for sampling methods that are not explained in detail

> Your methods, while informative, appear to be missing some information. Enough detail should be included so that a reasonable scientist can reuse and reinterpret the study without consulting you nor any other resources. This should hold true today, or even decades or a century from now. Users need to understand how the data were collected, how to interpret the values, and potentially how to use the data in the case of specialized files. We would be happy to add more content for you. Please provide us with a more robust methods section directly in this email or point us to a document from which we can extract more methods.

> NSF requires that comprehensive methods information be included directly in the metadata record. Pointers or URLs to other sites are unstable and insufficient.
